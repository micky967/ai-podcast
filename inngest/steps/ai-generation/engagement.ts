/**
 * AI Engagement & Growth Tools Generation Step
 *
 * Generates audience engagement assets using OpenAI GPT to help creators:
 * - Spark conversations with anticipated questions/comments
 * - Build community with welcoming pinned comments
 * - Maintain momentum with follow-up post ideas
 * - Create descriptions optimized for different contexts
 *
 * Output Formats:
 * - Comment Starters: 40 study flashcard questions with answers for memorization
 * - Pin Comment: Welcoming comment for YouTube to build community
 * - Community Posts: 3 follow-up ideas to keep audience engaged
 * - Descriptions: Short (preview), Medium (podcast feed), Long (blog/show notes)
 *
 * Integration:
 * - Uses OpenAI Structured Outputs (zodResponseFormat) for type safety
 * - Wrapped in step.ai.wrap() for Inngest observability and automatic retries
 * - Leverages transcript and chapters for context-aware suggestions
 *
 * Design Decision: Why engagement tools?
 * - Comments drive YouTube algorithm (engagement signals)
 * - Pinned comments set the tone for community culture
 * - Follow-up posts maintain audience connection between episodes
 * - Multiple description lengths support different distribution channels

   EXTRACTION PROCESS FOR DOCUMENTS:

   - Behind-the-scenes insights mentioned but not fully explored
   - Poll questions about topics discussed (A vs B, preferences)
   - Teaser for related upcoming content${isDocument ? "" : " or episodes"}
   - Quick tips or resources related to main topics
   - Each should be 1-2 sentences describing the post idea

   - One-sentence hook for social media previews
   - Captures essence and sparks curiosity
   - Includes biggest value proposition
   
   MEDIUM (300-500 chars):
   - Perfect for ${isDocument ? "content" : "podcast feed"} descriptions
   - Covers main topics${isDocument ? "" : " and guest (if applicable)"}
   - Includes 2-3 key takeaways
   - Ends with subtle CTA${isDocument ? "" : " (listen, subscribe, etc.)"}
   
   LONG (800-1000 words):
   - Comprehensive ${isDocument ? "content summary" : "show notes"} for blog or YouTube description
   - Detailed overview of all topics${transcript.chapters && transcript.chapters.length > 0 ? " and chapters" : ""}
   ${isDocument ? "" : "- Includes timestamps if relevant"}
   - Rich with keywords for SEO
   - Has sections for better readability
